## Features

### Core
- **Full Stats UI** — Three-tab window: Progress (with visual progress bar), Reward History, and Trait Catalog with drop chances
- **Right-click context menu** — Quick-check your kills and how many you still need
- **Smart trait conflict handling** — Mutually exclusive traits are automatically resolved (34 conflict rules)
- **Server-authoritative Multiplayer** — All trait changes validated and applied server-side
- **Full Singleplayer support** — Same features, no server needed
- **Weighted random rewards** — Higher trait cost = lower drop chance

### Sandbox Options (all configurable by the host)
- **Kill threshold** — Set how many kills per milestone (2–10,000, default: 1,000)
- **Progressive milestone scaling** — Milestones get harder over time, or keep it linear
- **Reward priority modes** — Gain First / Lose First / Random
- **Grant Missed Opportunities** — Install the mod mid-game? Get all your owed rewards at once
- **Individual trait toggles** — Enable/disable every single one of the 43 traits
- **Positive/negative rewards** — Toggle each reward type on or off

## Architecture

The mod follows a **client-server split architecture** designed for Build 42.13+:

```
┌─────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
│   BCR_Client     │         │   BCR_Server     │
│                  │         │                  │
│ • Kill tracking  │ ──MP──▶ │ • Validates kills│
│ • Milestone      │ command │ • Selects reward │
│   detection      │         │ • Applies trait  │
│ • Context menu   │ ◀────── │ • Persists data  │
│ • Notifications  │ response│ • transmitModData│
│ • Stats UI       │         │                  │
└────────┬─────────┘         └─────────────────┘
         │
         │ SP: calls BCR_Server
         │     functions directly
         │
    ┌────┴────────────┐
    │   BCR_Shared     │
    │                  │
    │ • Trait registry │
    │ • Weighted RNG   │
    │ • Milestone math │
    │ • Mutual excl.   │
    │ • Sandbox opts   │
    └─────────────────┘
```

- **Singleplayer:** Client calls server-side functions directly via `BCR.ProcessRewardDirect()`
- **Multiplayer:** Client sends `sendClientCommand()`, server validates and responds via `sendServerCommand()`
- **Shared module** contains all logic used by both sides (trait pools, milestone calculations, sandbox option parsing)

---

## Compatibility

- Built for **Project Zomboid Build 42.13.2+** (Unstable Branch)
- Works in both **Singleplayer** and **Multiplayer**
- **Safe to install mid-game** — reads your existing kill count
- **Safe to remove mid-game** — all earned traits are permanently applied
- **No vanilla file overwrites** — no conflicts with other mods

## Credits

Inspired by Circuit's [Kill Milestones (Zombies) B42](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3540255691). Great concept — this mod builds on that idea with more configuration options and multiplayer support.
